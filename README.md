# My-1st-project
Creating my Language Training Club LCT from now, I came up with the blueprint  for optimizing the process of second  language acquisition, well I'm working on it.

The Tower of Babel 
(Hebrew: מִגְדַּל בָּבֶל‎, Migdal Bavel) 
narrative in Genesis 11:1–9 is an origin myth meant to explain 
why the world's peoples speak different languages. According to the story, 
a united human race in the generations following the Great Flood, 
speaking a single language and migrating westward, comes to the land of Shinar (שִׁנְעָר).
There they agree to build a city and a tower tall enough to reach heaven. 
God, observing their city and tower, 
confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand each other, 
and scatters them around the world.

Be prepared to listen to a passionate rant if you ever ask a linguist about the importance of Linguistics.

Linguistics is the scientific sctudy of language.
Language and Culture is single concept in the same way than Language and Communication. 
Studying the communicative phenomena let us improve the efficiency of its use. 
Even monolingual people can be beneficiated by improving their communicative skills. 
Writing let us use facebook, reading let us have access to information. 
A second language let us to break social barriers.

As a linguist how would you define music, computer programming languages, 
morse code(or any sort encoding/encrypted/secret), binary? 
Would they be denoted as stand alone languages or more subsets of broader languages?
